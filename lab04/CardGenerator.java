//Use a random number generator to select a number from 1 to 52 (inclusive).  
//Each number represents one card, 
//and the suits are grouped:  Cards 1-13 represent the diamonds, 14-26 represent the clubs, then hearts, then spades.  
//In all suits, card identities ascend in step with the card number: 14 is the ace of clubs, 15 is the 2 of clubs, and 26 is the king of clubs.
